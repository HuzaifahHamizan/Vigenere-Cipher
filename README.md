# Ciphers Assignments

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of assignments focused on various encryption and decryption algorithms. The implemented ciphers include classical techniques like the Caesar Cipher, Vigenere Cipher, and Hill Cipher, as well as more advanced methods such as the Miller Rabin Algorithm and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).

## Contents

- **Caesar Cipher:** Implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique.
- **Vigenere Cipher:** Implementation of the Vigenere Cipher for more complex encryption.
- **Hill Cipher:** Matrix-based encryption method.
- **Miller Rabin Algorithm:** A probabilistic algorithm for primality testing.
- **AES:** Implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard.
